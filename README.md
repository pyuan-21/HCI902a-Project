## How to install
1. Download the APK file from the release section of the repo. 
2. Install the app on your Android VR device and Run.

**Note**: A device supporting at least Android 8.0 Oreo (API level 26) is required to be able to run this game.
<br/>
**Disclaimer**: This app was developed with the `Pico S` and its controller in mind. Some interactions may not be the same on other platforms. 

## How to play
Once you load into the world, appreciate its beauty and the global illumination first. Then you can point your `Raycaster` on any position on the terrain and click the `Trigger` to teleport there. You can also use the `dpad` or the `touch surface` to walk in the specified direction. <br/>


You can point at any tree in the world and then press the `Trigger` to cut it down and replace it with a factory or a house. Click repeatedly to choose the structure you prefer. 


Your actions have consequences. Cutting trees and placing factories will result in the `environment health` to drop and `money` to increase as displayed by the 2 dynamically updated `UI bars`. You will soon notice that also the `water level` continuously  rises to flood the world. 


Use the `volume up` or `volume down` button to adjust the music and sound effects' volume level to your liking.
